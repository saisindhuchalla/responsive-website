    <h1>Let's make Pani-Puri</h1>
    <h2>To make pani:</h2>
    <div class="left1"><img class="step1" src="./assets/images/step1.webp">
      <p class="card-text">Rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed mint leaves, 2 to 3 green chilies and 1 inch ginger very well in water a few times. Drain all the water. 
        Peel the ginger and roughly chop it. Also chop the green chilies. Roughly chop the coriander leaves and mint leaves.
        Don't use the stem of mint leaves as they can make the spiced water have a bitter taste. Only use the fresh mint leaves.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="right1"><img class="step2" src="./assets/images/step2.webp">
      <p class="card-text">Add coriander leaves, mint leaves, ginger and green chili in a grinder or blender jar. For a less spicy pani you can add just 1 chopped green chilli.
        Add 1 tablespoon tightly packed tamarind and 3.5 to 4 tablespoons jaggery powder or grated jaggery. If you do not have tamarind, then you can use 2 tablespoons lemon juice.
        Now add 1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder, 1 teaspoon chaat masala and salt as per taste.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="left2"><img class="step3" src="./assets/images/step3.jpg">
      <p class="card-text">Add ⅓ cup water and grind to a smooth consistency. Now add ½ cup water in the grinder jar and swirl the jar so that the chutney at the sides of the jar gets mixed with the water.      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="right2"><img class="step4" src="./assets/images/step4.webp">
      <p class="card-text">Then add ½ to ¾ cup water. You can add less or more water depending on the consistency you want. But do not add too much water as then the taste and flavor of the spiced water reduces.
      </p>
    </div>
